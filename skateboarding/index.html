   <p> Ive been skateboarding since january in 8th grade and its been one of my passions ever since <p>
     <p> First year of Skateboarding i was more focused on getting comforable and finding what style i like of skateboarding.</p>
            <p> What i love about skateboarding is when i skate i have no worries on whats going on in my life and it feels like a break from things </p>
